# Vuision
Arduino/Software based Synthesizer of user provided pitch and waveform. Played like a mix between a guitar and a violin.

The Vuision is a synthesizer that uses an Arduino Due, a potentiometer, buttons, a speaker, and a few other components to create dynamic sound. It's closest acoustic relatives are a guitar and a violin, however, it also shares similarities with many other potentiometer-based synthesizer.

The Vuision is comprised of two wooden slabs held together by four supports nailed/screwed to each corner of the Vuison. All of components of the Vuison are housed somewhere on the two wooden slabs - all inputs on the top and all operational and electrical processing on the bottom. All wiring is run through a hole in the top slab to the bottom. The Vuision takes three push buttons and a softpot membrane potentiometer as inputs from the user. Each button corresponds to a different waveform that will play/repeat when pressed, as long as the potentiometer is also pressed somewhere. If more than one button is pressed, the waveforms that are being played will average out and create a new waveform period. The potentiometer and push buttons must be pressed at the same time to produce sound and the potentiometer controls the pitch of the waveform.

Materials are: -Arduino Due 
-3 push buttons (Probably Linear) 
-Softpot Membrane Potentiometer 
-Solderless breadboard 
-Wires, capacitors, resistors, etc. [Needs change based off of configuration] 
-Screws and nails [Needs changed based off of configuration] 
-USB powered speaker 
-Sparkfun 3.5mm audio jack breakout 
-Power bank 
-Two woods slabs 
-Four wooden supports

Tools: 
-Soldering Iron 
-Drill 
-Tape 
-Hot Glue or Gorilla Glue
